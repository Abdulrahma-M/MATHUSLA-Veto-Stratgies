# MATHUSLA-Veto-Stratgies
 We introduce a sequence of veto strategies for LHC muons and their efficiencies, as well as compare the performance of the two possible detector floor/wall instrumentations: Hermetic vs Modular  
The main note book Veto_studies.ipynb contains both the analysis set up and the analysis itself.
Most secondary functions are in "00_analysis_config.ipynb".
